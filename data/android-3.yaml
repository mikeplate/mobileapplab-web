        Recommended to use since it will tell you if the method does not exist in the base class
        (if you've spelled it wrong)

    menu:
    - title: >
        When implementing an interface, you can also create a new anonymous class which primary/only
        purpose is to respond to events. Only one statement necessary.
    - title: Create an anonymous object and bind it to the event source
      language: java
      code: |
        btn.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
          public void onClick(View view) {
          }
        });
    - title: Inside onClick, "this" is the anonymous object
      description: >
        If you need the outer this (usually the Activity) reference it with class.this, like
        "Activity.this".
