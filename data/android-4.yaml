      menu:
      - title: >
          Add persistant storage to the previous mandatory assignment from chapter 1 called Summarizer.
          Use the SharedPreferences API on Android to store the current total in the application, and
          read it back when the application starts.
      - title: >
          Add persistant storage to the previous mandatory assignment from chapter 3 called Conversion.
          Use the SharedPreferences API to store the current value of the SeekBar, and read it back when
          the application starts (and set the position of the SeekBar accordingly).

      Perform this optional assignment to get one (1) extra credit.
    menu:
    - title: Prices
      description: >
        Create an application that stores products and prices in a SQLite databas and displays them
        in a ListView. Note that this assignment has been changed to include a SQLite database. If
        you've already created or started on it using the previous specification of storing in a
        ArrayList<HashMap<String,String>> object, that is ok too!
      menu:
      - title: >
          Create a layout with a ListView, two EditText elements and a Button. The two EditText elements
          shall be used to specify a product name and a product price. The Button shall be used to add
          new products to the list.
      - title: >
          Organize the elements in any way you like and feel free to add TextViews to show a label
          for the EditText elements if you like. Style them and use any kind of nested
          LinearLayouts in order to show them nicely in the user interface. The ListView should be
          set to extend to whatever height remains in the application after the other elements
          have been layed out.
      - title: >
          Create code for storing all products and their prices in a SQLite database table.
      - title: >
          When the user presses the Button, a new product object should be created and have its name
          and price set from the EditText elements. Add the new object to the database table that
          you created in the previous step.
      - title: >
          Use a SimpleCursorAdapter for the ListView to display the products. Choose any layout xml that 
          you like to display the individual items/rows in the list. You can use the built-in
          android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 if you like.
      - title: >
          Note that your app does NOT have to support editing or deleting of products. Just adding and
          displaying the products is enough to complete the assignment.

#- title: ListApp Example
#  description: >
#    Keep a list of categorized items. Categories can be added, as can items within those categories so the
#    data could be almost anything but it is somewhat streamlined as a todo-list. Demonstrates the ListView
#    visual element and persisting multiple data values in storage.
