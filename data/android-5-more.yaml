        Or at least switching between them fast enough for humans not to see the difference

        In Android, as in most operating systems, all user interface code runs in a single thread

        description: >
          Often not used since most user interface updating before the operation starts can just
          as easily be done before running the AsyncTask. Is run on main thread.
      - title: doBackground
        description: >
          This is where the long running code can be performed. Is run on a separate thread. Can't
          access anything in the user interface.
      - title: onPostExecute
        description: >
          Called with the returned value from doBackground. Is run on the main thread so the user
          interface can safely be updated here.

      The assignment is mandatory for a passing grade in the course.
    menu:
    - title: Headline App
      description: >
        Create an application that fetches the front page of your favorite news site on the internet,
        extracts the top headline and displays it in the application.
      menu:
      - title: >
          Create a user interface with a TextView and a Button.
      - title: >
          When the user presses the Button, fetch the front page of a news site on the internet using
          the AsyncTask class.
      - title: >
          Use Java string handling to find and extract the top headline from the html returned in the
          previous step. It's not that important exactly what you extract. If you have trouble
          extracting the exact top headline, anything extracted from the page is fine as long as it is
          a smaller piece of text suitable for a TextView.
      - title: >
          Display the extracted headline in a TextView.

    - title: Twitter Search App
      description: >
        Create an application that reads data in JSON format over the network, stores it in a SQLite
        database and displays it in a ListView. You are free to choose any kind of data, but a simple
        suggestion is to use the Twitter Search API. A network request that returns JSON can look like
        http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=androiddev
      menu:
      - title: >
          Store data for the application in a single table in a SQLite database.
      - title: >
          Display the data from that table in a ListView using a CursorAdapter. You are free to use
          any view to display the individual items in the table. You don't have to use a custom layout
          view that you define yourself. You can use the simple built-in layout 
          android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 if you like.
      - title: >
          Fetch data from a public web site on the internet using a documented API returning JSON data.
          Perform all network requests in a separate thread using the AsyncTask class.
      - title: >
          Store the retrieved data in a SQLite database. When downloading data, make sure you are not
          adding the same data again. You need to store a unique identifier in the database and perform
          a SELECT statement before adding new data and check if that unique identifier might already
          be present in the database. Only after getting an empty response from such a SELECT/query call,
          the new data should be inserted into the database.
      - title: >
          Display the data from the SQLite database using a ListView and CursorAdapter. A simple string
          for each item in the ListView is enough to display.
      - title: >
          Create a button in the user interface to manually start a request and download new data. Note
          that you should automatically refresh the ListView once new data has been retrieved and stored
          in the SQLite database.
