    menu:
    - title: How classes/code are put in files
      menu:
      - title: Java forces one class for each file. One single file for each class.
      - title: >
          Objective-C follows C in separating the class declaration and implementation
          into two different files. Convention to have one pair of file for each class
          but not enforced by the language.
    - title: Strictness in objects and methods
      menu:
      - title: >
          Java is very strict. In order to call a method it must be known by compiler
          from the class definition.
      - title: >
          Objective-C is more loosely typed. Can write code where a method is called,
          without knowing for sure if it will be there when the code runs. Methods
          can be added dynamically while the application is running.

      - title: Instance method members start with -
      - title: Class (static) method members start with +
    - title: Statements in Objective-C are put inside [ and ]
      description: >
        This is the main features that makes Objective-C code backwards compatible with C.
        Everything inside of [ and ] are Objective-C statements and most other statements
        are valid C code.
