  menu:
  - Android SDK
  - Android SDK Manager
  - Android Virtual Device Manager
  - Android Emulator
  - Eclipse
- title: Android SDK
  menu:
  - title: Contains tools and files necessary to build Android applications
  - title: Possible to build applications with only the SDK and its command line tools
  - title: Recommended to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse
  - title: No installation, just unzip the files
  - title: Many, if not all, tools require Java to run
- title: Eclipse
  menu:
  - title: Open source IDE written in Java for developing all kinds of applications, not just Android apps
    description: >
      Most used for Java development, but also supports (via plugins and custom builds) C, C++,
      HTML, JavaScript and more.
  - title: Download from http://eclipse.org
    description: >
      Different downloads just differs in what default plugins are included. Use "for Java development"
      when building Android applications, or download the package from the Android site since it nowadays
      also includes Eclipse (but maybe not the latest version).
  - title: Customizable
    description: >
      Eclipse is very customizable and competent with a lot of features you might find in other IDEs like
      Microsoft Visual Studio. It does depend a lot of local settings and files created during its use that
      may be corrupted or introduce errors in the environment. Restart Eclipse or even remove the .metadata
      folder in your Workspace to "reset" the environment if strange errors occur.
- title: Android Plugin for Eclipse

    menu:
    - title: Eclipse will ask for this location when restarting the first time after the ADT has been installed
    - title: Can also be set/changed inside Eclipse
    - title: Choose "Window, Preferences, Android" and specify "SDK Location"
    - title: The list below "SDK Location" in this dialog box should contain all downloaded Android versions

        This setting is stored as part of your Workspace, so changing to an empty Workspace means this
