      You will create an app for quickly sending an SMS message by calling out to the standard
      Android SMS app. The app will contain three predefined messages and three predefined
      recipients, each represented by a button. The user chooses a message and then the user
      to which the message will be sent. Immediately after choosing the recipient, the standard
      Android SMS app is started with the message and recipient preselected in the app. You need to
      remember the chosen message so you know what it was, when the recipient button is clicked.

        Create three buttons with message titles, for instance: "I'll be late", "Meet me at the usual location" and
        "I'm here. Waiting outside for you". Use string resources for the text and reference the string resource
        from the button XML.

        Create a handler in the activity class for each button, and store something each time a
        specific button is pressed so you know which message to send when the time comes.

        Create three additional buttons. Set the buttons' titles to three friedly names like "Alice", "Bob" and
        "Cathy". Use string resources for the text and reference the string resource from the button XML.

        Create a handler in the activity class for each recipient's button and launch the standard Android

      You will add an Activity and a few buttons to the previous app. The new Activity will be used for

        Add a new Button with the text "Translate" to the Activity, just below the existing message button 
        "I'm here. Waiting outside for you".
      description: >
        When the user presses this button, the app shall open the web browser with a URL to Google Translate
        for translating the message to Spanish. The beginning of such an URL looks like this: 
        http://translate.google.com/m/translate?sl=en&tl=es&q= So, for instance, to translate "horse"
        to Spanish, you would open the following URL: http://translate.google.com/m/translate?sl=en&tl=es&q=horse
    - title: >
        Add a new Button with the text "Location" to the Activity, just below the existing message button
        "Meet me at the usual location". Also, remove the ending of the message to it now only reads
        "Meet me at ".
    - title: >
        Add a new Activity to the app. The new Activity should have three Buttons with the names "Home",
        "Work" and "Pub". You can call it LocationActivity, but the exact name doesn't matter though you
        need to call it something of course.

        Start the new Activity when the user presses the "Location" button you added previously.
    - title: >
        When the user presses any of the three buttons in the LocationActvitity, it should end and the
        user be returned to the first Activity. But before you end it, you shall also make sure that the
        particular button that was pressed, is returned to the first Activity and used there when
        the user the next time wants to send that message. Instead of just sending "Meet me at ", it should
        of course send "Meet me at home", "Meet me at work" or "Meet me at the pub" depending on which
        of the buttons the user chose.
