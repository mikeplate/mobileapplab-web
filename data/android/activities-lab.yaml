    The assignment is mandatory for a passing grade in the course.

  - title: Dispatcher
    description: >
      You will create an app for quickly sending an SMS message by calling out to the standard
      Android SMS app. The app will contain three predefined messages and three predefined
      recipients, each represented by a button. The user chooses a message and then the user
      to which the message will be sent. Immediately after choosing the recipient, the standard
      Android SMS app is started with the message and recipient preselected in the app. You need to
      remember the chosen message so you know what it was, when the recipient button is clicked.
    menu:
    - title: >
        Use a LinearLayout for your activity and place all buttons below each other, making them fill the entire
        width of the activity.
    - title: >
        Create three buttons with message titles, for instance: "I'll be late", "Meet me at the usual location" and
        "I'm here. Waiting outside for you". Use string resources for the text and reference the string resource
        from the button XML.
    - title: >
        Create a handler in the activity class for each button, and store something each time a
        specific button is pressed so you know which message to send when the time comes.
    - title: >
        Create three additional buttons. Set the buttons' titles to three friedly names like "Alice", "Bob" and
        "Cathy". Use string resources for the text and reference the string resource from the button XML.
    - title: >
        Create a handler in the activity class for each recipient's button and launch the standard Android
        SMS app with the message and recipient phone number. Just make up any phone number you want for each
        person.

  - title: Dispatcher II
    description: >
      Separate the previous Dispatcher app into two different activities and add some messages and
      recipients. The first activity will be the message chooser, and the second activity will be
      the recipient chooser.
    menu:
    - title: >
        Add a second activity to the app and move the buttons for the recipients ("Alice", "Bob" and
        "Cathy") to the second activity. The functionality should otherwise be the same as previously,
        except for any modifications below. When the user clicks one of the message buttons in the
        first activity, the second activity is launched (and the message remembered somehow). When the
        user clicks one of the recipient buttons in the second actitivy, the standard Android SMS
        app is launched with the chosen message and recipient phone number.
    - title: >
        One reason for separating into two separate activities could be to have room for more messages
        and recipients to choose from. Illustrate this by adding a few messages to the the first activity
        and a few recipients to the second activity (as additional buttons).
    - title: >
        Create a fourth button in the first activity as a shortcut to sending the same SMS message as
        the last time. Set the text of the button to both the message and the recipients name so that
        the user is aware of what will happen when the button is clicked. When the button is clicked, you
        launch the standard Android SMS app immediately (without the second activity) since you already
        know what message to send and to whom.
    - title: >
        Also create logic so that it works the first time the app
        is ever used, when there isn't any "last time message and recipients" available. In that case,
        nothing should happen when the button is clicked.
