    The assignment is mandatory for a passing grade in the course.

  - title: Traveltime
    description: >
      Create an app that calculates the time it takes to travel a certain amount of distance using
      a chosen transportation method.
    menu:
    - title: >
        Create three TextViews at the top of the app. They will, in order, show the speed of
        transporation, the distance and finally the calculated time.
    - title: >
        Create a Spinner below the TextViews with entries for four different transportation
        methods that will be the basis for the speed in our calculations. The entries will be
        "Bycycle", "Car", "Train" and "Aeroplane". In your calculations, lets assume the typical
        speeds for these transporation methods, in kilometers per hour, are 20, 90, 160, 850.
    - title: >
        Respond to the Spinner event that is fired as soon as the user chooses a different entry
        from it. Show the speed corresponding to the chosen entry in the top TextView.
    - title: >
        Create a SeekBar below the Spinner, representing the distance of your calculations
        ranging from 0 to 1000 kilometers.
    - title: >
        Respond to the SeekBar event that is fired as soon as the user moves the location of the
        thumb in the SeekBar. Show the value as kilometers in the second TextView.
    - title: >
        Add code so that you calculate the time it will take to travel, using the current speed
        and distance, and show the time in the third TextView. The calculation should be updated
        immediately whenever the Spinner or the SeekBar changes.
    - title: >
        Add a menu command to the ActionBar.

      Continue on the Traveltime app from the previous assignment and add event handlers for a few
