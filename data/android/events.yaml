  menu:
  - title: Everything that happens in an Android app is the result of
    menu:
    - title: An event being fired by the system, possibly from user interaction
    - title: A method being called to respond to that event
    - title: Except if you start your own threads to run in parallell
  - title: You've already responded to at least two events in your apps
    menu:
    - title: The creation of the Activity sent as an event to the onCreate method
    - title: The click of an Button sent as an event to the specified onClick method
- title: Some more examples of events
  menu:
  - title: Activity events
    menu:
    - title: Back button was pressed
    - title: A menu item was chosen by the user
    - title: A second Activity finishes and returns the result
  - title: View events
    menu:
    - title: An item was selected in a Spinner
    - title: A button was clicked for a longer period of time
    - title: The user has touched somewhere in the View
  - title: System events
    menu:
    - title: A SMS text message has been received
    - title: Battery level is low
    - title: The user has chosen to share something from another app with your app
- title: Respond to an event
  menu:
  - title: Event handlers
    menu:
    - title: You've already seen that an event handler is a Java method that is called when the event occurs
    - title: All event handlers should return as quickly as possible since the user interface will be blocked
  - title: In a Java class
    menu:
    - title: Your class "extends" a base class and can then override the event handler methods in the base class
    - title: Can choose any number of supported event handlers to override
  - title: Or in a Java interface
    menu:
    - title: Your class "implements" an interface and can then implement the event handler methods defined by the interface
    - title: Must implement all event handlers in interface, but can just leave them empty if not relevant
- title: Example of overriding method from base class
  menu:
  - title: onBackPressed is fired when back button is pressed on device
    language: java
    code: |
      public class MyActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onBackPressed() {
          // Do whatever you like!
        }
      }
  - title: Your method will be called instead of base class method
    menu:
    - title: In some cases it is important to call base class method too (read documentation)
    - title: Or if you just want to duplicate what base class method does
    - title: super.onBackPressed();
- title: Example of implementing interface in anonymous class
  menu:
  - title: Call setOn... for object that fires event
    language: java
    code: |
      Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);
      btn.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View view) {
          // Do what needs to be done!
        }
      });
  - title: If event handler access variables outside of itself, they need to be final
    description: final TextView output = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.some_output_box);
- title: Activity lifetime events
  menu:
  - title: Events fired by the Activity and handled by overriding methods in your own Activity class
  - title: onCreate

- title: General View event interfaces
  menu:

    - title: This event is fired when the user has touched and released a finger on the view
    - title: void onClick(View src)
  - title: OnTouchListener
    menu:
    - title: This event is fired when the user touches, moves and releases any amount of fingers on the view
    - title: boolean onTouch(View src, MotionEvent event)
  - title: OnLongClickListener
    menu:
    - title: This event is fired when the user touches and holds an amount of time on the view
    - title: boolean onLongClick(View src)
- title: Spinner event
  menu:
  - title: OnItemSelectedListener
    description: >
      This event is fired when the user has chosen an option from the drop down list
  - title: Two methods in interface
    menu:
    - title: void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> src, View selectedView, int selectedPosition, long selectedId)
      description: >
        Depending on how the entries of the Spinner was specified, there might not be any selectedId that is
        valid. Best to use the selectedPosition if the order of options is well known.
    - title: void onNothingSelected(AdapterView<?> src)
      description: >
        Not applicable to a Spinner. The event interface is shared with other visual elements where such
        an event is valid.
- title: SeekBar
  menu:
  - title: Visual element with a knob that you move between endpoints to set a value
    description: >
      Actually extended from the base Progress element that has no interaction and only shows some sort
      of visual progress bar while waiting for an operation to complete
  - title: Attributes
    menu:
    - title: android:max
      description: >
        The maximum value that corresponds to moving the knob to the right-most position
    - title: android:progress
      description: >
        The default value to start at (zero is always the value when the knob is in the left-most position)
- title: SeekBar event interfaces
  menu:
  - title: OnSeekBarChangeListener
    menu:
    - title: void onStartTrackingTouch(SeekBar source)
      description: >
        Called when the user first touches the knob, before moving it
    - title: void onProgressChanged(SeekBar source, int pos, boolean byUser)
      description: >
        Called on every movement of the knob
    - title: void onStopTrackingTouch(SeekBar source)
      description: >
        Called when the user has released the knob and the operation is finished
  - title: >
      Even if you only need to catch onProgressChanged, all methods must be defined (but can be empty)
