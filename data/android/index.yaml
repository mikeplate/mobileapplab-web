      description: >
        You are free to choose between Eclipse and Android Studio for your development environment. I would
        recommend Android Studio as your first choice and only resort to Eclipse if your first choice fails
        (since it is a new environment that is not even in beta status yet).

        You don't submit anything for this assignment. It is still important to spend time in the beginning to
        make sure that your environment works when you start the REAL assignments in the next chapter.
