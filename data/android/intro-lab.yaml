- title: Assignment
  description: >
    You don't submit anything for this assignment. It is still important to spend time in the beginning to
    make sure that your environment works when you start the REAL assignments in the next chapter.
  menu:
  - title: Your first app
    description: >
      Familiarize yourself with the development environment. Use the default project and make sure that
      all steps work, like creating the project, building the app, starting the Emulator etc.
    menu:
    - title: Install Java SE Development Kit (if you don't already have it)
      description: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
    - title: Install Android Studio (0.3.2 at the moment)
      description: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html
    - title: Start Android Studio and let it autoupdate to latest version (0.4.2 at the moment)
      description: >
        Running the latest version is perhaps not necessary for the course, but since it is a fresh
        application it is probably wise to always have the latest version with as many bug fixes as
        possible.
    - title: Create your first project with default settings
    - title: Start Android Virtual Device Manager and create a virtual phone in it
    - title: Build and run your first project with Shift+F9
      description: >
        The first time, the emulator will take too long to start and Android Studio will timeout. Just
        wait until the emulator is running and then try again with Shift+F9 in Android Studio.
  - title: For computers where you can't install anything
    description: >
      Specifically for lab room computers at school, where you don't have permissions enough to install
      an application, you can use a prepared zip file and run from it instead. Use these steps only if
      installation according to above is not possible.
    menu:
    - title: Download file with prepared Java and Android Studio for 64-bit Windows
      description: http://mobileapplab.se/files/AndroidDev64.zip (819 MB)
    - title: >
        Unzip the files, preferably not in your home folder or a network folder since it is quite large.
        A good place to unzip could be C:\Temp where you should have write permissions.
    - title: Start by double-clicking the file "Start Andriod Studio.vbs".
    - title: Continue with same procedure as above from "Create your first project"
  - title: Faster emulator for Intel processor
    description: >
      These are the steps to download and install optimized emulation for the Inter processor so that
      the emulator will run faster.
    menu:
    - title: Start Android SDK Manager
    - title: Under your preferred version (4.4.2), select "Intel x86 Atom System Image"
    - title: Under "Extras", select "Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)"
    - title: Click "Install Packages" to install the selected components
    - title: Find the downloaded file in "android-studio\sdk\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\IntelHaxm.exe" or ".dmg" on Mac
    - title: Install it with default values
    - title: Start Android Virtual Device Manager
    - title: >
        Create a new phone, make sure to select your preferred version (4.4.2) as "Target" and select "Intel Atom (x86)" as "CPU/ABI".
        If the "Intel Atom (x86)" isn't available, you've probably not installed the previous components successfully.
    - title: Your new virtual phone should now run faster. The startup is still pretty slow, but it will run faster after that.
