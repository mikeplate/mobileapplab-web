      Same application as IntelliJ IDEA for a lot of other development tasks
  - title: Free and Open Source

    description: >
      This is the Android version that you are aware of and which features you would like access to, assuming
      that you know not to call/use any features between "Minimum required SDK" and this version when running
      on older devices. Recommend the latest.
