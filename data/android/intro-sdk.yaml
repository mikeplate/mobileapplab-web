      description: A binary for running virtual phones in the emulator, emulating the ARM processor (slow)
    - title: Intel x86 Atom System Image
      description: >
        A binary for running virtual phones in the emulator using native Intel processor (faster). For
        this to work you also need to install the Intel x86 Emulation Accelerator.
    - title: Google Play Services
      description: Not used in the course, but contains a lot of extra APIs not available in the operating system
    - title: Intel x86 Emulation Accelerator (HAXM)
- title: Android Virtual Device Manager
  menu:
  - title: Tool in the SDK to create virtual devices and then launch them inside the Android Emulator
  - title: Start
    menu:
    - title: Menu/button in the development environment (Eclipse or Android Studio)
    - title: Run "android avd" from the command line inside the tools directory of the SDK
  - title: Create new virtual devices
    menu:
    - title: Choose an Android version for the phone
    - title: Choose an image (ARM or possibly x86 emulation)
    - title: Choose memory and other features
  - title: Start a virtual device in the Android Emulator

    menu:
    - title: Slow to start. Ok to use (hopefully). Keep it open!
    - title: Specify "Hardware keyboard" to type using your computer keyboard

    - title: adb is a command line tool to communicate with the emulator
    - title: Multiple running emulators can "call" each other using the port number
- title: Common errors
  menu:
  - title: Syntax errors in layout xml file
    description: >
      Typing wrong element or attribute names in the xml file is common and are usually not discovered
      until starting your application. Note that most names are case sensitive. Also note that most
      attributes is prefixed with "android:". The exception thrown is seldom helpful.
  - title: Wrong onClick method
    description: >
      If the value of the "android:onClick" attribute does not match the method in your Java class, this is
      not discovered until the application runs. The name much match exactly, including case, but the method
      must also be "public void" and take a View as its single argument.
  - title: Forgetting to request a permission
    description: >
      Some operations like performing a network request requires a permission to be specified in your
      AndroidManifest.xml file. Without it, an exception will be thrown the first time network communication
      is attempted.
  - title: Forgetting to declare extra Activities
    description: >
      If your app has more than one Activity, it is common to forget that besides creating a layout xml
      and an Java source code file you also need to declare it in AndroidManifest.xml.
- title: Faster Android Emulator
  menu:
  - title: Android Emulator is slow
    menu:
    - title: >
        Because it is as close to a physical device as is possible. A full compile of the Android platform
        for ARM processors. Since it needs to emulate the ARM processor, it will always be slow.
    - title: >
        Not always a bad thing. The advantage is that the speed of emulator will not fool you with regards
        to how fast your code will run on physical devices.
  - title: Use a x86 image instead
    menu:
    - title: A full compile of the Android platform, but for Intel x86 processors
    - title: This will be faster since it means that no ARM processor emulation is necessary
    - title: Requires installation of "Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)"
      description: >
        Install it from the Android SDK Manager (under Extras). Requires administrative access on your
        computer.
    - title: Then install "Intel x86 Atom System Image" for the Android version
    - title: And create a virtual device that uses the "Interl x86..." image instead
