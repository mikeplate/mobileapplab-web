  Overview of the tools and technologies for building native Android applications.
menu:
- title: Goals
  menu:
  - Know about the essential tools in the Android SDK
  - Get familiar with the development environment
  - Create and start a virtual Android phone using the Emulator
- title: Android SDK
  menu:
  - title: Contains tools and files necessary to build Android applications
  - title: Possible to build applications with only the SDK and its command line tools
  - title: Recommended to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    menu:
    - title: Eclipse
    - title: Android Studio
  - title: Many, if not all, tools require Java to run
- title: Tools
  menu:
  - title: Android SDK Manager
    description: Download further components and update the existing tools
  - title: Android Virtual Device Manager
    description: Create virtual phones with different screen sizes and other features
  - title: Android Emulator
    description: Run a virtual phone created with the Virtual Device Manager
  - title: DDMS
    description: Show and investigate the insides of a running phone, physical or virtual
- title: Android SDK Manager
  menu:
  - title: Download and update components of the SDK
  - title: Important components
    menu:
    - title: At least one Android version
  - title: Start
    menu:
    - title: Menu command in Eclipse under Window menu
    - title: Run "android sdk" from the command line inside the tools directory of the SDK
    - title: On Windows, you can also start "SDK Manager.exe"
- title: Android Virtual Device Manager
  menu:
  - title: Tool in the SDK to create virtual devices and then launch them inside the Android Emulator
    menu:
    - title: Menu command in Eclipse under Window menu
    - title: Run "android avd" from the command line inside the tools directory of the SDK
    - title: On Windows, you can also start "AVD Manager.exe"
  - title: Create new virtual devices
    menu:
    - title: Choose an Android version for the phone
    - title: Choose an image (ARM or possibly x86 emulation)
    - title: Choose memory and other hardware features (emulated)
  - title: Start a virtual device in the Android Emulator
- title: Android Emulator
  menu:
  - title: Very close to a real device
    menu:
    - title: Slow to start. Ok to use (hopefully). Keep it opened.
    - title: Specify "Hardware keyboard" to type using your computer keyboard
    - title: Physical buttons on a physical device will be extra buttons in the Android Emulator window
  - title: Can be scaled/resized when running on computers with smaller screens
  - title: Each running emulator has a local tcp port number for control/communication
    menu:
    - title: adb is a command line tool to communicate with the emulator
    - title: Multiple running emulators can "call" each other using the port number
- title: Common errors
  menu:
  - title: Syntax errors in layout xml file
    description: >
      Typing wrong element or attribute names in the xml file is common and are usually not discovered
      until starting your application. Note that most names are case sensitive. Also note that most
      attributes is prefixed with "android:". The exception thrown is seldom helpful.
  - title: Wrong onClick method
    description: >
      If the value of the "android:onClick" attribute does not match the method in your Java class, this is
      not discovered until the application runs. The name much match exactly, including case, but the method
      must also be "public void" and take a View as its single argument.
  - title: Forgetting to request a permission
    description: >
      Some operations like performing a network request requires a permission to be specified in your
      AndroidManifest.xml file. Without it, an exception will be thrown the first time network communication
      is attempted.
  - title: Forgetting to declare extra Activities
    description: >
      If your app has more than one Activity, it is common to forget that besides creating a layout xml
      and an Java source code file you also need to declare it in AndroidManifest.xml.
- title: Faster Android Emulator
  menu:
  - title: Android Emulator is slow
    menu:
    - title: >
        Because it is as close to a physical device as is possible. A full compile of the Android platform
        for ARM processors. Since it needs to emulate the ARM processor, it will always be slow.
    - title: >
        Not always a bad thing. The advantage is that the speed of emulator will not fool you with regards
        to how fast your code will run on physical devices.
  - title: Use a x86 image instead
    menu:
    - title: A full compile of the Android platform, but for Intel x86 processors
    - title: This will be faster since it means that no ARM processor emulation is necessary
    - title: Requires installation of "Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)"
      description: >
        Install it from the Android SDK Manager (under Extras). Requires administrative access on your
        computer.
    - title: Then install "Intel x86 Atom System Image" for the Android version
    - title: And create a virtual device that uses the "Interl x86..." image instead
- title: Logging
  menu:
  - title: Console View in Eclipse
    description: >
      This view shows commands that Eclipse runs when building, debugging etc. The source of these messages
      is usually Eclipse or some other tool in the SDK. Make sure to select the Android view (not DDMS).
  - title: LogCat View in Eclipse
    description: >
      This view shows messages from the running Android Emulator or a physical device (if connected).
      These messages will be quite verbose, but can filtered to only show errors.
  - title: Output your own LogCat messages
    description: >
      You can also output your own messages to the LogCat View using Log.i, Log.w and Log.e calls from
      your Java code (corresponding to Information, Warning and Error log levels of importance).
- title: DDMS (Dalvik Debug Monitor Server)
  menu:
  - title: Communicates with a running Emulator or actual Phone/Device
  - title: Take screenshots from the device
  - title: Transfer files to/from the device
  - title: Show logs and debugging messages
  - title: Show status information about processes
  - title: Show network usage
