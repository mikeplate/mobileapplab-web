- title: Menus on Android
  menu:
  - title: For the course, menus and the Action Bar are the same thing
  - title: Most (all older) Android devices have a physical menu button
    description: >
      Requirement was removed when tablets and Android 3.0 appeared, where the menu button can appear as
      a virtual button on the screen instead.
  - title: Therefore, two versions depending on Android version
    menu:
    - title: Menu pops up from the bottom of screen (older version, before 3.0)
    - title: Menu pops down from the so called ActionBar at the top of screen (from 3.0)
  - title: You can write the same code and the platform will display using the appropriate version
- title: Menu handling
  menu:
  - title: Your choice of menu is not specified or set in any call
  - title: Instead an event is sent to your Activity when it is time to create the menu(s)
  - title: Menu items (and buttons/icons for the Action Bar) can be created
    menu:
    - title: Dynamically in Java code at the time of the event
    - title: Statically in an XML resource file that is loaded at the time of the event
    - title: Or even a combination of both
    - title: We'll only see the XML method in the course
- title: Defining your menu(s)
  menu:
  - title: Create XML resource file in menu directory, for instance main.xml
    language: xml
    code: |
      <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <item android:id="@+id/do_something"
            android:title="@string/do_something_menu_title"
            android:orderInCategory="100"
            android:showAsAction="never" />
      </menu>
  - title: Load in Activity event onCreateOptionsMenu
    language: java
    code: |
      @Override

          getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.main, menu);
          return true;
      }
- title: Display options for the Action Bar items
  menu:
  - title: Attributes on item element
    menu:
    - title: id is the usual identifier that you use in if statements to responed to the correct choice
    - title: title should be a string reference for translation purposes
    - title: orderInCategory is a number that defines the order in which items appear
    - title: icon is a drawable resource to show instead of the title (or both with "withText")
  - title: showAsAction
    menu:
    - title: always means to always show it on screen (in the Action Bar)
    - title: never means to only show it in drop down menu
    - title: ifRoom means to try and show it on screen if width allows
    - title: withText displays both icon and title if both present
- title: Responding to menu selection
  menu:
  - title: Event sent to Activity when user has chosen an option
    language: java
    code: |
      @Override
      boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        if (item.getItemId()==R.id.do_something) {
          doSomething();
          return true;
        }
        return false;
