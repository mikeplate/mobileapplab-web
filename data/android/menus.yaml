  - title: Most (all older) Android devices have a physical menu button
    description: >
      Requirement was removed when tablets and Android 3.0 appeared, where the menu button can appear as
      a virtual button on the screen instead.
  - title: Therefore, two versions depending on Android version
    menu:
    - title: Menu pops up from the bottom of screen (older version, before 3.0)
    - title: Menu pops down from the so called ActionBar at the top of screen (from 3.0)
  - title: You can write the same code and the platform will display using the version at hand
    description: >
      All methods and callbacks (event handlers) are the same for the two versions
- title: Menu handling
  menu:
  - title: Event sent to Activity to create options in the menu
    description: >
      So can't be set statically at any point. I guess because menu options are more often than not
      dependent on the current context, selected item etc.
  - title: Example
    language: java
    code: |
      @Override
      boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        menu.add(NONE, 123, 1, "Do something");
        return true;
      }
  - title: Event sent to Activity when user has chosen an option
    language: java
    code: |
      @Override
      boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        if (item.getItemId()==123) {
          doSomething();
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      }
