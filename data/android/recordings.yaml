  These recordings are not the best quality and they are very specific to the current run of the course in 2014 at JTH

    The recordings are in low resolution 1024x768 and the sound quality is not the best, but I hope it is still better
    than not being able to watch the lectures afterwords at all. The file format is MKV (Matroska), which should be
    playable in most media players, at least VLC.
