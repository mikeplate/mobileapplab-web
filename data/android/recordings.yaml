    The recordings are in low resolution 1024x768 and the sound quality is not the best, but I hope it is still better
    than not being able to watch the lectures afterwords at all. The file format is MKV (Matroska), which should be
    playable in most media players, at least VLC.

      The lecture was an overview of the Android platform and the tools needed to install the development environment.
      If you follow the steps at http://mobileapplab.se/android/introduction-to-android-development/introduction-assignments
      you are reasonably up-to-date for lecture 2 below.
