  - title: Change style of View by setting attributes on the xml element
  - title: Multiple attributes can be collected into a Style
    description: >
      A Style and its attributes are put in its own xml file and referenced in the View element. An
      Android Style is somewhat similar to a CSS class.
  - title: Themes is a way to apply multiple styles automatically for an Activity
    description: >
      Themes are specified on the Activity (or the Application as a whole). Themes are also the way for
      different Android platform versions to update its appearence of the same View objects.
      An Android Theme is somewhat similar to a CSS stylesheet.

      Screen pixels. 1px is simply always one pixel on the screen.
  - title: dp (or dip)
    description: >
      Density-independent pixels. This unit is based on the physical density of the screen, relative to a
      screen with 160 pixels/inch. A size with this unit should have the same physical size on all
      screens from tiny 3 inch to tablet 10 inch sizes, independently of the pixel resolution of those
      screens. This is the recommended unit for all sizes except textSize.
  - title: sp
    description: >
      Size-independent pixels. This is like the dp unit, but is also scaled according to an optional
      user setting for font size. This is the recommended unit for textSize.

      How the actual View is aligned horizontally and vertically with regards to its container
      or "available area". Also depends on the type of layout that is used. If the View has
      "match_parent" for its width and/or height, this attribute will not have an effect.
