      Create an app to convert values between different units. Let's pick conversion of speed
      between kilometers per hour and miles per hour, and weight betweeen kilograms and pounds, but
      feel free to choose some other units and conversions if you want.
    menu:
    - title: >
        Create an EditView at the top of the app where the user will input the source value
    - title: >
        Create a TextView below the EditView that will hold the result from converting the source value
    - title: >
        Create four buttons for the different unit conversions. Place two buttons next to each other
        and the third and forth button below the two first. The text on the buttons will be
        "To km/h", "To mph", "To kilograms", "To pounds" signifying what unit to convert TO, assuming
        the other unit is input into the EditView.
    - title: >
        Handle button presses in onClick methods, perform the converstion depending on what button
        was pressed, and show the result in the TextView

        Create an alternate layout for landscape orientation. It is not important exactly what you
        change in the layout, but one suggestion is to split the screen in half and not have any
        View fill more than 50% of the screen width.

      Extend the previous Conversion app with the following functionality.

    - title: >
        Replace the four buttons for choosing unit conversion with a Spinner. Add a "Convert" button that
        performs the conversion instead. The user will first choose the wanted conversion from the
        Spinner, and then press the "Convert" button to calculate the result.
    - title: >
        Create three buttons with the following values: 1, 10, 50. Each time one of these buttons
        is pressed, the corresponding amount will be added to the current source value in the EditView.
        Use the same onClick method in your Java code for all buttons and determine what value to
        actually add from the onClick argument.
    - title: >
        Give the three added buttons in the previous step some custom styling. It can be a different text
        size, background color and so on. Put the styling in a style-element in an XML file and reference
        this style from the three buttons.
