  - title: Currency Rate
    description: >
      Create an app with a home screen widget that displays the current rate of a currency
      you choose (and what primary currency to relate the rate to). Fetch the rate from a
      web API or web page. If you have some other piece of information that you'd like to
      display instead, that is fine too. The criteria for the app is that it fetches a value
      over the network and displays it in a home screen widget at some interval.

        Start by creating the main functionality of the app in a normal activity. It is a good
        idea to make the network and display functionality work first, and then put it into a
        home screen widget. Create an app with a TextView and a Button. When the button is
        pressed, the current value should be fetched from the network and displayed in the
        TextView.

        Suggested network source for fetching a currency rate is to use the follow URL that
        will return JSON data for the currency rate between Swedish Krona SEK and Bitcoin.
        https://api.bitcoinaverage.com/ticker/global/SEK/ Change the currency from SEK to
        something closer to your heart, if you like to. Use the "last" property for the
        display.
    - title: >
        Add a home screen widget to the app following the steps needed from the presentation.
        The widget shall at least contain a TextView object for displaying the value. Make sure
        the widget works with a static (not updated) value and that it can be added to the home
        screen.
    - title: >
        Specify an update period of 8 hours for the widget using the attribute in the widget
        XML specification file. This is perhaps not the best way to do continuous updates,
        but for simplicity reasons, it will have to do for this assignment.
    - title: >
        Add code to the button in the app so that each click on the button also manually
        (without relying on the update period) updates the displayed currency in all widgets
        of your type. This might not be necessary in a real app, but for testing purposes
        it is a good feature to have.

        Add views to the activity in the app so that two things can be configured. The first
        configuration is what currency to use as base. It the previous example, the "SEK"
        part of the URL. You don't have to check the value, just create an EditText view
        where the user can change this value to something else, assuming it will work ok by
        just replacing it in the URL when the currency rate is fetched.
    - title: >
        The second configuration is a low and high end value for the currency rate that,
        when reached, will result in some other features as below. Create two EditText views
        for the low and high value. While testing, you can input values so that the current
        value will be below the low value or above the high value to test your code for the
        following features.
    - title: >
        Change the color of the text or the background in the widget if the current rate value
        is below the low configuration value, or above the high configuration value. Choose
        whatever color you want, but an suggestion is to use black color as the default and
        then switch to red if below and green if above.
    - title: >
        Add a notification using the notification system on Android to display a message if
        the value is below the low configuration value. The notification can display any icon
        and a title with a text like "Currency is low at 1234" or something similar.
