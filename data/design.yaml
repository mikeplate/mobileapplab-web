    - title: The web and open standards such as HTML5 and CSS3 are moving fast and changing/adding all the time
    - title: The mobile web is (surpringsly?) at the front
      menu:
      - iOS is a little bit better at adopting new features than Android
      - Market penetration of a recent version is a lot better on iOS than on Android

  - title: CSS basics - style properties
    menu:
    - title: A style property changes the appearance of an html element
    - title: Has a name defined by the standard and a value that you specify
    - title: Apply to individual html elements
      language: html
      code: |
        <div style="color: blue; text-align: center;">Text</div>
    - title: Recommended to put style properties into classes instead
  - title: CSS basics - class definitions
    menu:
    - title: A CSS class is a collection of style properties
      language: css
      code: |
        .headline {
          color: #ff0;
          background-color: #a0663e;
        }
    - title:  The selector specifies which html elements the class is applied to
      menu:
      - By Tag - div
      - By Class - .headline
      - "By Id - #save"
    - title: Combining selectors to be more specific

  - title: Use CSS classes
    menu:
    - title: You use CSS classes by ensuring that the selector matches the wanted html elements
      language: html
      code: |
        <div>Just by tag name</div>
        <h1 class="headline">By specifying the class name as an attribute</h1>
        <button id="save">By setting an id of the element</button>
    - title: Some practices
      menu:
      - Use html element selectors where possible. Doesn't require any additional html. However, can also
        be too generic to match the particular elements you want.
      - Using class names and the class attribute on the actual html elements is the most used method.
  - title: CSS basics - stylesheets
    menu:
    - title: A stylesheet is a collection of classes
    - title: Stylesheet as an element in the html file
      language: html

  - title: Browser vendor prefixes
    menu:
    - title: CSS3 is still under development
      menu:
      - Not all browsers support all CSS3 features
      - Browser vendors often (but not always) implement new styles using their own prefixes.
        After some time, when the standard at W3C has stabilized, they may also choose to remove
        it and implement the style without a prefix.
    - title: Webkit
      description: >
        Both iOS and Android browsers are based on Webkit and uses the prefix "-webkit" for such styles
    - title: Best strategy to implement all known prefixes

      description: >
        Can be specified anywhere where an image url is valid as a style property value. Note that this
        CSS3 feature is a value (and not a new property).
    - title: More than one syntax
      menu:
      - title: Android browsers before version 3.0 only support older syntax
        language: css

                           color-stop(0, #339), color-stop(1, #fff))

  - title: More gradient usages
    menu:
    - title: Multiple solid colors in an image
      menu:
      - title: Doesn't have to produce a gradient to be useful
      - title: Specify same position for both colors, and they will be solid and not gradient
        language: css
        code: |
          -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom,

  - title: Things to consider on mobile networks
    menu:
    - title: Latency
      description: >
        A request to a web server is more expensive on mobile networks than on wired. Latency is the time
        to the receive the first byte after sending a request.
    - title: Images, being downloaded separately from html, are subject to latency
      description: >
        More images means added latency even though usually up to three concurrent requests
        are used by web browsers.
    - title: Image size, larger images takes longer to download
      description: >
        Not as bad as latency, but mobile networks are usually slower than wired and 3G networks slower
        than WiFi.

    - title: Unicode is a standard for representing more than 110000 characters
    - title: All modern web pages (html files and their server delivery) should be done in Unicode
    - title: Unicode is commonly encoded into bytes using UTF-8

    menu:
    - title: Why?
      menu:

    - title: Image data is encoded in Base64 format to ensure all bytes are printable
      menu:
      - 3 binary bites will expand to 4 printable characters
      - Larger size is usually outweighed by fewer requests
      - Extremely large lines/text can be difficult to view/scroll in your text editor

      menu:
      - One single image file
      - Display just a part of the image file at a specific location
      - Uses the CSS capability of panning a background image
    - title: Usage
      menu:
      - Merge all images into one image file
      - Set image file as background image
      - Set CSS3 style background-position to pan the wanted part of the image into view
      - Note that you need any html element that can have a background to insert the sprite
      - Merge images in your image editing application or use services such as http://spritegen.website-performance.org/ or http://spriteme.org/
    - title: Example
      language: css
      code: |
        .sprite {

        properties of the browser window/screen such as width or orientation
    - title: Specified as a container of CSS classes in a style element

  expand: true
  menu:
  - title: Assignment 1 (mandatory)
    menu:
    - title: Create a list optimized for mobile
      description: >
        Create an html file with a list of at least five product names. Choose whatever names you
        like. Use any html elements you like (ul/ol and li is not mandatory, you can just as well use a div
        element for each item in the list). Style the list with CSS. Each item should expand to the full
        width of the browser window up until a maximum of 800 pixels. Each item should also have a gradient
        background. Use at least five CSS style properties in total. Exactly what you use and how it looks
        is up to you. For example, use CSS style properties box-shadow, background-image, font-size,
        border and padding. The page should have a viewport that specifies a one-to-one pixel ratio between
        the viewport and the screen of the mobile device.
  - title: Assignment 2 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Add images to the list items
      description: >
        Continue on the previous assignment. Add an image to each of the items (products) in the list.
        The image should appear next to the item text on the left side. Merge the images
        into a single image file and use image sprites to show each individual image next to the item.
        Also add a media query so that the images are hidden for widths below 480 pixels.
  - title: Assignment 3 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Add title to the list and 
      description: >
        Continue on the previous assignment. Add a title to the list, consisting of any suitable text
        and an image. The title should always remain visible, even when there are so many items in the 
        list that scrolling down is possible. Research the "fixed" style property on your own to solve
        this (other solutions might work and are fine). The chosen image should be inserted as an inline
        image with Base64-encoded data inside the html file. Use a media query so that the title image
        is shown above the title text in portrait orientation, but to the left of the title text in
        landscape orientation.
