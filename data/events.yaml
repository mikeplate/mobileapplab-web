        the event (if relevant).

        Many events have default handlers in the browser that can be prevented from executing, if wanted.

      language: html
      code: <h1 onclick="doSomething();">
    - title: By setting the element property

      code: obj.onclick = doSomething;
    - title: By calling addEventListener for the element
      language: javascript

      language: javascript
      code: obj.attachEvent("onclick", doSomething);
  - title: Anonymous functions
    menu:
    - title: Often used as event handlers
    - title: A function with no name must be used at the same time as it is defined
    - title: Example
      language: javascript
      code: |
        obj.addEventListener("click", function(eventinfo) {
          alert("Got a click in the app!");
        }, false);

    - title: Internet Explorer stores it in window.event (NOT sent as argument)
    - title: Information depends on the type of event
      menu:
      - target is always the element that caused the event to fire
      - keydown has code of key pressed
      - mousedown has position of mouse
      - touchstart has position of touch
    - title: Example that is browser independant
      language: javascript
      code: |
        function whenEventHappens(evinfo) {
          evinfo = evinfo ? evinfo : window.event;

    - title: Fired when the web page has loaded all content
    - title: Important not to manipulate elements too early (before they exist)
      menu:
      - Don't do anything until inside the load event handler
      - Or place the JavaScript code in a script element at the end of the body
    - title: Ways to catch
      menu:
      - title: In the body element using an attribute
        language: javascript
        code: <body onload="doIt();">
      - title: Set the window property
        language: javascript
        code: window.onload = doIt;
      - title: Add function to window object
        language: javascript
        code: window.addEventListener("load", doIt, false);
      - title: And remember you can use an anonymous function instead of doIt
  - title: Default event processing
    menu:
    - title: Prevent the default action after your event handler has been called
      language: javascript
      code: evinfo.preventDefault();
    - title: Events will bubble up
      description: >
        The event is always first dispatched to the element where the event happened.
        Then the event is dispatched to the parent element and this continuous up until
        the topmost element the window (for most events).
    - title: Strategy
      description: >
        Instead of catching events on a lot of elements, one strategy can be to catch
        events on a parent element and then check event information for which particular
        element actually fired the event.
    - title: Prevent bubbling of events
      language: javascript
      code: evinfo.cancelBubble = true;
  - title: Mouse events
    menu:
    - title: These events will to some extent be simulated on touch enabled devices, even though they have no mouse support
      description: >
        Since you are aware of mobile devices, it is usually best NOT to rely on simulated events and instead
        catch and implement handlers for the actual touch events.
    - title: mousedown
      description: When mouse button is pressed. Event info will have information about which mouse button.
    - title: mousemove
      description: Whenever the mouse is moved over an element
    - title: mouseup
      description: When mouse button is released. Note that this event might not fire if the mouse is released outside of the element.
    - title: mouseover (mouseenter is similar)
      description: When the mouse pointer first enters the inside of an element. Use for "hover" effects.
    - title: mouseout (mouseleave is similar)
      description: When the mouse pointer is moved outside of an element after previously being inside.

    - title: evinfo.targetTouches
      description: An array of only the fingers that are pressed on the element that fired the event
    - title: Each item in the array has additional properties
      menu:
      - title: pageX has horizontal screen position of touch
      - title: pageY has vertical screen position of touch
      - title: Example
        language: javascript
        code: |
          var x = evinfo.touches[0].pageX;
          var y = evinfo.touches[0].pageY;
  - title: Pattern for supporting both mouse and touch with common code
    menu:
    - title: Catch both events

  - title: Strategies to discover errors
    menu:
    - title: alerts
      menu:
      - title: >
          Create alert()-calls in your code to verify that you reach a certain point and/or show

      menu:
      - title: >
          Catch the error event for the window object and show the error to yourself or take other action.
          Assumes that JavaScript at least reaches the code point at which the event is caught.
      - title: Example
        language: javascript
        code: >
          window.onerror = function(event) {

    - title: Catch touch events on link elements
      menu:
      - title: >
          Create a web app with two buttons. The buttons should be a or button elements in the html so that they
          can be used on non-touch devices, but you shall also catch the touchstart event to get a responsive
          web app on touch devices too.
      - title: >
          One button shall change the background color of the web page (to any
          color you want).
      - title: >
          The other button shall add a new html element to the web app. It doesn't matter
          what you add as long as it is visible in the app (like an image or a div-element with some text).
  - title: Assignment 2 (optional)

    - title: Change color when touching list items
      menu:
      - title: >
          Create a web app with a list of items. It could be products. Every item in the list should at least
          have a text. You can use a previous assignment with a product list if you like.
      - title: >
          Catch the touch event for every item in the list. When an item is touched it shall change
          color (background color or something else, as long as it is visible). If an item is touched
          again, it should change back to whatever the color was initially.
  - title: Assignment 3 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Move list items when touch-dragging
      description: >
          A user interface for rearranging items in a list with touch and drag operation can be very
          complex. You don't have to create the best interface. You can make it as easy as you like,
          as long as your app can detect the difference between some sort of up/down touch-n-drag
          and then change the position in some way for an item in the list.
      menu:
      - title: >
          Use the previous web app with a list of items, or create a new similar one. Use whatever
          code you like to detect a touch drag operation up or down on a particular item. If so
          happens, that item should change place with the item above (for up) or below (for down).
      - title: >
          There are two tasks here that you need to perform/investigare: detecting up/down motion
          for touch and moving an html element in a web page.

          You are NOT allowed to use a third-party library, jQuery plugin or similar that might
          already have code that does the hard work.
