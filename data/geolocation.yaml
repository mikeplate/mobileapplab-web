  web application and inside of PhoneGap.

    The contents are still under development so be sure to check back here closer to the actual
    lecture and the week when the chapter is presented. The exercises are complete and you can
    start with them. If I do feel the need to change something in an exercise (to make them clearer
    or easier), any assignment you've submitted to the original specification will of course be approved.

    menu:
    - title: A position on earth
    - title: Latitude
      menu:
      - Horizontal lines on the globe
      - Position relative to the equator
      - Positive for north. Negative for south.
    - title: Longitude
      menu:
      - Vertical lines on the globe
      - Position relative to the Meridian that passes through Greenwich
      - Positive for east. Negative for west.
  - title: Calculations
    menu:
     - title: Unit
       menu:
       - Single number like 57.7787
       - Or in degress+minutes like 57Â°46.722' N
     - title: Distance between two locations
       menu:
       - Not as simple as using pythagoras theorem since the earth is not flat
       - Haversine formula
       - Databases capable of such calculations are called spatial
     - title: Direction from one location to another
       menu:
       - Also called bearing
       - Specified in 0-360 degrees where 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 south and 270 west
     - title: Sunrise and sundown
       menu:
       - Can be determined from location and the time of year
     - title: Geolocation API in browsers
       menu:
       - Not formally an HTML5 specification, but it was formed in the same time frame.

  menu:
  - title: Assignment 1 (mandatory)
    menu:
    - title: Fetch and display the geoposition of the user
      menu:
      - title: Create a web application that fetches the position of the user using the geolocation API.
      - title: Display the position in latitude and longitude somewhere in the page.
      - title: Pick a predetermined location, like where you live, and calculate the distance between
               the two locations and display it to the user when the position of the user has been
               determined.
      - title: Use the JavaScript function for calculating distance from the demos.
  - title: Assignment 2 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Homing application
      menu:
      - title: Create a homing application that can tell you how far and in what direction a custom
               location is from where you are now. The application should have two buttons.
      - title: The first button determines the position of the user and stores it as the "home"
               position. Nothing else but a successful message about the location have been 
               determined need to be shown.
      - title: The second button also determines the position of the user. If a "home" has been
               set with the first button, the application should display the distance and direction
               from the current position to the home position. The direction can be displayed in
               degrees from north (assuming the user will know where north is).
      - title: Use web local storage for storing the home position.
      - title: Use the JavaScript functions for calculating distance and direction from the demos.
  - title: Assignment 3 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Homing application in PhoneGap with compass
      menu:
      - title: Extend the previous assignment and package it as a PhoneGap application.
      - title: Use the watchPosition function in the geolocation API to get continuous information
               about the position.
      - title: Use the compass API in PhoneGap to also determine the direction that the user is facing.
      - title: Use both the compass direction and the direction to the home position to display in
               which way to move to get home in a better way than just "degrees from north". You don't
               have to display a graphical compass. It is enough to show "left" or "right" to tell
               the user in which way to face.
      - title: Note that the compass is not changable in the Android Emulator so you need a physical
               device to really try out your application, but for the assignment it is of course to
               have written code that accepts the same values from the PhoneGap API.
