    The contents are still under development so be sure to check back here closer to the actual
    lecture and the week when the chapter is presented. The exercises are complete and you can
    start with them. If I do feel the need to change something in an exercise (to make them clearer
    or easier), any assignment you've submitted to the original specification will of course be approved.

    - title: Latitude
      menu:
      - Horizontal lines on the globe
      - Position relative to the equator
      - Positive for north. Negative for south.
    - title: Longitude
      menu:
      - Vertical lines on the globe

     - title: Unit
       menu:
       - Single number like 57.7787
       - Or in degress+minutes like 57Â°46.722' N
     - title: Distance between two locations
       menu:
       - Not as simple as using pythagoras theorem since the earth is not flat
       - Haversine formula
       - Databases capable of such calculations are called spatial
     - title: Direction from one location to another
       menu:
       - Also called bearing
       - Specified in 0-360 degrees where 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 south and 270 west
     - title: Sunrise and sundown
       menu:
       - Can be determined from location and the time of year
     - title: Geolocation API in browsers
       menu:
       - Not formally an HTML5 specification, but it was formed in the same time frame.
  - title: Determine geolocation on a mobile device
    menu:
    - title: IP to country database
      description: >
        All IPs are registered to a company, located in a known country. Does not always tell the
        whole truth. IP to country databases are freely available on the net.
    - title: WiFi triangulation
      description: >
        WiFi routers broadcast their names and a unique ID. By driving around and collecting all those
        identifiers and the current position, a database is built. Detecting strength/proximity to
        those identifiers gives a good accuracy inside of cities with many WiFi routers.
        Not freely available.
    - title: Mobile network triangulation (3G)
      description: >
        Information provided by the phone company (carrier) by also measuring the strength/proximity to
        mobile network antennas, and knowing where those antennas are located.
    - title: GPS - Global Position System
      description: >
        Satellite signals that can be received by a GPS receiver in a mobile device. Usually the best
        accuracy, but also most demanding on battery.
  - title: Geolocation API
    menu:
    - title: Available in all modern browsers
    - title: Always requires consent from the user before delivering the position to a web application
    - title: No specific control over what method is used
      description: >
        Can specify "high" accuracy, but not defined exactly what that would mean.
    - title: Determine current location as a one time measurement
    - title: Determine location as a continuous movement
      description: >
        Not that reliable in web browsers since any continuous events about location might stop when
        the user uses other applications (like gets an incoming call)
  - title: Use the Geolocation API
    menu:
    - title: Call navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
      description: >
        Always asynchronous, meaning function will return immediately and you provide a function that
        the API will call once the location has been determined.
    - title: Specify a function to call on success
    - title: Specify a function to call on error
    - title: Specify other settings for making the determination
  - title: Use the Geolocation API
    menu:
    - title: Example
      language: javascript
      code: |
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(whenPosition, whenError, { timeout: 20000 });
        function whenPosition(result) {
        }
        function whenError(error) {
        }

  menu:
  - title: Assignment 1 (mandatory)
    menu:
    - title: Fetch and display the geoposition of the user
      menu:
      - title: Create a web application that fetches the position of the user using the geolocation API.
      - title: Display the position in latitude and longitude somewhere in the page.
      - title: Pick a predetermined location, like where you live, and calculate the distance between
               the two locations and display it to the user when the position of the user has been
               determined.
      - title: Use the JavaScript function for calculating distance from the demos.
  - title: Assignment 2 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Homing application
      menu:
      - title: Create a homing application that can tell you how far and in what direction a custom
               location is from where you are now. The application should have two buttons.
      - title: The first button determines the position of the user and stores it as the "home"
               position. Nothing else but a successful message about the location have been 
               determined need to be shown.
      - title: The second button also determines the position of the user. If a "home" has been
               set with the first button, the application should display the distance and direction
               from the current position to the home position. The direction can be displayed in
               degrees from north (assuming the user will know where north is).
      - title: Use web local storage for storing the home position.
      - title: Use the JavaScript functions for calculating distance and direction from the demos.
  - title: Assignment 3 (optional)
    menu:
    - title: Homing application in PhoneGap with compass
      menu:
      - title: Extend the previous assignment and package it as a PhoneGap application.
      - title: Use the watchPosition function in the geolocation API to get continuous information
               about the position.
      - title: Use the compass API in PhoneGap to also determine the direction that the user is facing.
      - title: Use both the compass direction and the direction to the home position to display in
               which way to move to get home in a better way than just "degrees from north". You don't
               have to display a graphical compass. It is enough to show "left" or "right" to tell
               the user in which way to face.
      - title: Note that the compass is not changable in the Android Emulator so you need a physical
               device to really try out your application, but for the assignment it is of course to
               have written code that accepts the same values from the PhoneGap API.
