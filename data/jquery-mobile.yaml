    page with all slides after one another.

  - title: JavaScript Libraries
    menu:
    - title: Easy access to the capabilities of modern browsers
      description: >
        No magic. Everything could be done with plain JavaScript, well it IS.
    - title: Advantages
      menu:
      - Handles browser differences internally
      - Touch and gesture support
      - User interface components (widgets)
      - Structuring your code (MVC and similar frameworks)
    - title: JavaScript can be used outside of the browser too
      description: >
        Don't mistake all JavaScript libraries, modules and components as runnable in web browsers.
        Some are also made for JavaScript frameworks like Node.js for other purposes than surfing the web.
  - title: How to use a JavaScript library
    menu:
    - title: Add script element to your page
      language: html
      code: |
        <script src="backbone.js"></script>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    - title: Download to your own site or use public CDN (Content Delivery Network)
      description: >
        By downloading, you supply the file from your site. More traffic, not reusable between sites but it
        will work when/if CDN is down (almost never). For mobile, latency issues can make downloading the
        best option but I usually recommend using public CDNs. Only the major libraries have public CDNs.
    - title: User interface libraries usually also requires linking in css files
    - title: Read the documentation
  - title: Some noteworthy JavaScript libraries
    menu:

        is important. Would be more difficult on the standard JavaScript/DOM.

    - title: User interface library
      description: >
        With simple html elements and attributes according to the specification a user interface
        optimized for mobile is injected into your page

      description: >
        jQuery Mobile injects its own elements to the DOM changes which can be difficult to grasp
    - title: Harder to customize
      description: >
        The purpose of jQuery Mobile is not to make too many customization. If such are needed, you
        might be better off building your user interface without the library.
