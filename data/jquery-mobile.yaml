      language: html
      code: |
        <script src="backbone.js"></script>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    - title: Download to your own site or use public CDN (Content Delivery Network)
      description: >
        By downloading, you supply the file from your site. More traffic, not reusable between sites but it
        will work when/if CDN is down (almost never). For mobile, latency issues can make downloading the
        best option but I usually recommend using public CDNs. Only the major libraries have public CDNs.

      description: >
        Purpose of a templating library is to be able to define the HTML for snippets of your page as
        ordinary HTML and not have to do large blocks of string concatenation in your JavaScript to build
        new elements.

      language: javascript
      code: |
        var index = 1, name = "Mike";
        var html = "<div id=\"unique\"" + i + ">" + name + "</div>";
    - title: You can do this in your HTML
      language: html
      code: |
        <div class="unique{{index}}">{{name}}</div>
    - title: And then this in your JavaScript
      code: |
        var template = Handlebars.compile(document.getElementById("template").innerHTML);
        var html = template({ index: 1, name: "Mike" });
