        Don't mistake all JavaScript libraries, modules and components as runnable in web browsers.
        Some are also made for JavaScript frameworks like Node.js for other purposes than surfing the web.

    - title: Add script element to your page
      language: html
      code: |
        <script src="backbone.js"></script>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    - title: Download to your own site or use public CDN (Content Delivery Network)
      description: >
        By downloading, you supply the file from your site. More traffic, not reusable between sites but it
        will work when/if CDN is down (almost never). For mobile, latency issues can make downloading the
        best option but I usually recommend using public CDNs. Only the major libraries have public CDNs.

      description: >
        With simple html elements and attributes according to the specification a user interface
        optimized for mobile is injected into your page
    - title: DOM changes
      description: >
        jQuery Mobile injects its own elements to the DOM changes which can be difficult to grasp
    - title: Harder to customize
      description: >
        The purpose of jQuery Mobile is not to make too many customization. If such are needed, you
        might be better off building your user interface without the library.

    - title: Templates in HTML and JavaScript
      description: >
        Purpose of a templating library is to be able to define the HTML for snippets of your page as
        ordinary HTML and not have to do large blocks of string concatenation in your JavaScript to build
        new elements.
    - title: Instead of doing this
      language: javascript
      code: |
        var index = 1, name = "Mike";
        var html = "<div id=\"unique\"" + i + ">" + name + "</div>";
    - title: You can do this in your HTML
      language: html
      code: |
        <div class="unique{{index}}">{{name}}</div>
    - title: And then this in your JavaScript
      code: |
        var template = Handlebars.compile(document.getElementById("template").innerHTML);
        var html = template({ index: 1, name: "Mike" });
