    - title: HTML
      description: >
        Thorough knowledge of HTML tags and building web pages in general is assumed.
    - title: CSS
      description: >
        Some basic about CSS should be known, like how stylesheets, class names, selectors and
        style properties are built and their purpose.
    - title: JavaScript
      description: >
        The course will not try and explain or describe the JavaScript language in any detail,
        but experience of any other programming language will probably be enough for coping with
        the JavaScript code we will write here.
    - title: Mobile devices
      description: >
        Not a strict requirement, but it is assumed that you have some experience of using a modern
        mobile device even though you may not own one. All exercises can be performed with a
        computer and emulator of some sort.

  - title: Options for Native Applications
    menu:
    - title: Android
      description: >
        Java is the language. Eclipse is the development environment. Free to download the Android
        SDK and Eclipse which are both open source project. Works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
        Will need to pay $29 one time fee to publish applications in Google Play Store.
    - title: iOS
      description: >
        Objective-C is the language. Xcode is the development environment. Free to
        download and use Xcode from the App Store, but only works on Mac OS X. Will need to pay
        $99/year to publish applications in iTunes App Store.
    - title: Windows Phone
      description: >
        .NET is the programming platform with options to use C# or Visual Basic as language.
        Visual Studio is the development environment. Express version of Visual Studio is free
        to download and can be used for Windows Phone development.

  - title: Our Tools
    menu:
    - title: Browser
      description: >
        Chrome is most similar to the standard browser on Android and iOS devices since they all
        share the same base code WebKit (open source project backed by Apple).
    - title: Editor
      description: >
        Any text editor will be fine. For Windows, you can use Notepad++ or Visual Studio. For
        Mac OS X you can use TextMate or Coda. For hard core developers on all operating systems
        you can use vim/gvim/MacVim.
    - title: Emulator
      description: >
        To run and test your code without a real mobile device you can use some sort of emulator.
        Opera Emulator can be used to emulate touch events. Android Emulator is the one closest
        to a real device that can run on Windows, but it is also slow and requires some setup. For
        Mac OS X you can also use the iOS Simulator which is part of Xcode.
    - title: Web Server
      description: >
        Most of our programming will be performed on the client side (in the browser). Where server
        programming might be required, it will be presented in both Php and ASP.NET/C#. For
        participants on campus, a Linux web server with Php and ASP.NET support (via Mono) will be
        provided.

      description: >
        Create two web pages, one with a layout suitable for desktop browsing and one with a layout
        suitable for mobile browsing. Then detect which device the visitor has using the User-Agent
        HTTP header and select one of the pages to show. Use any technique for detection and page
        selection, like server side php or client side JavaScript.
