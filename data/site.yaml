    menu:
    - title: HTML
      description: >
        Thorough knowledge of HTML tags and building web pages in general is assumed.
    - title: CSS
      description: >
        Some basic about CSS should be known, like how stylesheets, class names, selectors and
        style properties are built and their purpose.
    - title: JavaScript
      description: >
        The course will not try and explain or describe the JavaScript language in any detail,
        but experience of any other programming language will probably be enough for coping with
        the JavaScript code we will write here.
    - title: Mobile devices
      description: >
        Not a strict requirement, but it is assumed that you have some experience of using a modern
        mobile device even though you may not own one. All exercises can be performed with a
        computer and emulator of some sort.

  - title: Options for Native Applications
    menu:
    - title: Android
      description: >
        Java is the language. Eclipse is the development environment. Free to download the Android
        SDK and Eclipse which are both open source project. Works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
        Will need to pay $29 one time fee to publish applications in Google Play Store.
    - title: iOS
      description: >
        Objective-C is the language. Xcode is the development environment. Free to
        download and use Xcode from the App Store, but only works on Mac OS X. Will need to pay
        $99/year to publish applications in iTunes App Store.
    - title: Windows Phone
      description: >
        .NET is the programming platform with options to use C# or Visual Basic as language.
        Visual Studio is the development environment. Express version of Visual Studio is free
        to download and can be used for Windows Phone development.

  - title: Our Tools
    menu:
    - title: Browser
      description: >
        Chrome is most similar to the standard browser on Android and iOS devices since they all
        share the same base code WebKit (open source project backed by Apple).
    - title: Editor
      description: >
        Any text editor will be fine. For Windows, you can use Notepad++ or Visual Studio. For
        Mac OS X you can use TextMate or Coda. For hard core developers on all operating systems
        you can use vim/gvim/MacVim.
    - title: Emulator
      description: >
        To run and test your code without a real mobile device you can use some sort of emulator.
        Opera Emulator can be used to emulate touch events. Android Emulator is the one closest
        to a real device that can run on Windows, but it is also slow and requires some setup. For
        Mac OS X you can also use the iOS Simulator which is part of Xcode.
    - title: Web Server
      description: >
        Most of our programming will be performed on the client side (in the browser). Where server
        programming might be required, it will be presented in both Php and ASP.NET/C#. For
        participants on campus, a Linux web server with Php and ASP.NET support (via Mono) will be
        provided.

          Taking pictures with the camera. Running code in the background. Being notified of system
          events.
      - title: PhoneGap
        description: PhoneGap is the bridge between the Mobile Web, running inside a so called
          WebView, and the native mobile platform. Will give access to camera, accelerometer and
          more (and can be extended to do more or less anything that a native application can do).

      menu:
      - title: Testing code that relies on User Agent for detection
        description: >
          Start Google Chrome with --user-agent parameter for any choice of a mobile device's
          user agent.
      - title: Testing code that relies on touch capabilities
        description: >
          Run Opera Mobile Emulator. It is possible to load local files from the file system
          with that emulator. Or run the configured Android Emulator, however in that case
          you need the pages delivered via http (either locally or on a remote web server)
          since it is totally unaware of the computers local file system.
      - title: Testing code that relies on the Viewport
        description: >
          Run the Android Emulator or a real device. Opera Mobile Emulator does not respond
          to the Viewport meta tag, and neither does Google Chrome.
      - title: Testing code for visual compliance/design
        description: >
          Run Google Chrome on the computer. It is similar enough for most things discussed in
          this course. Don't use Opera Mobile Emulator for this, other than if you really want
          to make sure it looks ok in Opera Mobile on a device (and you probably do?).
      - title: Testing code for other mobile/HTML5 specific features such as geolocation
        description: >
          Run Google Chrome on the computer. Most (all?) HTML5 features available on mobile devices
          are also supported by Google Chrome. However, for geolocation you will never receive any
          position changes (or, at least not in a controlled manor, due to it relying on WiFi or
          IP for positioning). Android Emulator supports making it accept any location you provide
          over a command line, although a bit cumbersome to do.
  - title: Exercises
    menu:
    - title: Investigate existing mobile web sites
      description: >
    - title: Build two web pages optimized for desktop and mobile
      description: >
        Create two web pages, one with a layout suitable for desktop browsing and one with a layout
        suitable for mobile browsing. Then detect which device the visitor has using the User-Agent
        HTTP header and select one of the pages to show. Use any technique for detection and page
        selection, like server side php or client side JavaScript.
