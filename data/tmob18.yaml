- title: Prerequisites
  menu:
  - title: >
      This knowledge will help you a lot but even without it, any experience of IT and development
      should be enough to follow along and complete the course.
  - title: HTML
    description: Know how html files are structured and the use of the most common html tags
  - title: CSS
    description: Know what css is and how it works for styling html content
  - title: HTTP
    description: Know difference between server-side and client-side scripts, form posting, query strings, cookies
  - title: JavaScript
    description: >
      Know the basics of the language such as functions and if-statements and how it is included in
      web pages. Actually any language in the same family of languages such as C, C++ and Java will
      get you familiar with javascript quickly.
- title: Tools
  menu:
  - title: Google Chrome
    description: >
      Desktop browser based on the same engine (WebKit) as both Android and iOS browsers and
      therefore your best choice to get the design right
  - title: Opera Mobile Emulator
    description:
      Fastest and most easy to use emulator that is available on all desktop platforms (Win, Mac, Linux). Primarily for testing
      viewport and touch, which is not supported by Google Chrome.
  - title: Android SDK and Emulator
    description:
      More accurate emulator for being as close as a real device that is possible without actually
      testing on the device. Requires some setup and is unfortunately very slow to start (while
      running, ok).
  - title: Your own choice of text editor
  - title: Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    description: Only used in the context of PhoneGap for building packaged applications for a specific platform (Android in our case)
- title: Web Server
  menu:
  - title: Not required
    description: >
      Although some assignments can be implemented with server scripts, it is not necessary. Access
      to a web server is not required to complete the course.
  - title: Examples
    description: >
      There might still be some examples of how to solve certain tasks using server scripts. In
      those cases, php is the primary technology but asp.net might also be shown.
  - title: At JTH, everybody has a personal web site
    description: >
      Unfortunately it hasn't worked that good in the past, but everyone with an account at JTH can
      put files in G:\public_html and have them visible on the web at http://jth.hj.se/~username
      where username is your own network login name at JTH.
