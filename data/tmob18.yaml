  - title: Building mobile web sites and applications
    description: >
      This course will demonstrate building applications (and sites) for mobile devices using
      standard technologies on the open web such as html, css and javascript.
  - title: It will not include native development
    description: >
      Native development means that you are using the platform manufacturer's own software development
      kit and technologies to develop an application, like Objective-C on iOS and Java on Android. However, we will
      look at packaging a web application to "look" native using PhoneGap in this course.
- title: Syllabus
  menu:
  - title: 1. Detection
    description: >
      How to recognize a mobile user. Viewport for proper scaling on mobile devices.
  - title: 2. Design
    description: >
      CSS3 capabilities and some performance considerations for mobile. Nothing really mobile
      specific, applicable to desktop browsers too.
  - title: 3. Events
    description: >
      Reacting to events in the browser to perform actions, primarily the touch event for mobile
      devices.
  - title: 4. Data
    description: >
      Storing data in the browser. Communicating over the net. Nothing specific for mobile, equally
      applicable to desktop too.
  - title: 5. PhoneGap
    description: >
      Packaging the web page/site/app into an application that is compatible with Google Play Store
      (or iTunes App Store).
  - title: 6. Geolocation
    description: >
      Getting and handling information about the user's location. Supported by desktop browsers too,
      but perhaps of less use there.
  - title: 7. jQuery Mobile
    description: >
      Primarily a user interface library for mobile devices to get started fast on an application
      and not have to worry about different mobile devices.

      Presentations published in Ping Pong in addition to the web site http://mobileapplab
      Live coding during lectures also uploaded as a zip file to Ping Pong.
  - title: Coding examples
    description: >
      Other coding examples besides those produced during live coding in the lectures, might also be
      available. Published at http://mobileapplab.se
  - title: Assignments
    description: >
      For each week/subject: one mandatory and two optional for extra credit in the Ping Pong exam.
      Published in Ping Pong.
- title: Course examination
  menu:
  - title: Written exam in Ping Pong with multiple choice questions
    description: Probably about 20 questions with half of them as the passing grade limit
  - title: Assignments that must be completed to pass course
    description: One assignment per week but last (6 in total). Due the end of the last week (2012-12-16 23:59).
  - title: Extra assignments that can be completed to receive additional points on the written exam
    description: Two assignments per week but last (18 in total).
  - title: Project that must be completed to pass course
    description: >
      You can see it as a slightly largerand more cohesive/useful assignment of your choosing.
      There are no other requirements than it should be based on the contents of the course. The
      project can be performed in a group of 2 or 3 students. Projects will be presented by the
      participants at a later time (to be scheduled). Due at the day of presentation.
- title: Prerequisites
  menu:
  - title: >
      This knowledge will help you a lot but even without it, any experience of IT and development
      should be enough to follow along and complete the course.
  - title: HTML
    description: Know how html files are structured and the use of the most common html tags
  - title: CSS
    description: Know what css is and how it works for styling html content
  - title: HTTP
    description: Know difference between server-side and client-side scripts, form posting, query strings, cookies
  - title: JavaScript
    description: >
      Know the basics of the language such as functions and if-statements and how it is included in
      web pages. Actually any language in the same family of languages such as C, C++ and Java will
      get you familiar with javascript quickly.
- title: Tools
  menu:
  - title: Google Chrome
    description: >
      Desktop browser based on the same engine (WebKit) as both Android and iOS browsers and
      therefore your best choice to get the design right.
  - title: Opera Mobile Emulator
    description:
      Fastest and most easy to use emulator that is available on all desktop platforms (Win, Mac, Linux). Primarily for testing
      viewport and touch, which is not supported by Google Chrome.
  - title: Android SDK and Emulator
    description:
      More accurate emulator for being as close as a real device that is possible without actually
      testing on the device. Requires some setup and is unfortunately very slow to start (while
      running, ok).
  - title: Your own choice of text editor
  - title: Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    description: Only used in the context of PhoneGap for building packaged applications for a specific platform (Android in our case)
- title: Web Server
  menu:
  - title: Not required
    description: >
      Although some assignments can be implemented with server scripts, it is not necessary. Access
      to a web server is not required to complete the course.
  - title: Examples
    description: >
      There might still be some examples of how to solve certain tasks using server scripts. In
      those cases, php is the primary technology but asp.net might also be shown.
  - title: At JTH, everybody has a personal web site
    description: >
      Unfortunately it hasn't worked that good in the past, but everyone with an account at JTH can
      put files in G:\public_html and have them visible on the web at http://jth.hj.se/~username
      where username is your own network login name at JTH.
